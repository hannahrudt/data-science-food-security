## Project Description:
### This group project examines how various food security measures and socioeconomic factors are correlated with early vaccination rates in the US (March 2021). 

## Personal Contributions and Strengths:
- Data descriptions show my ability to familiarize myself with with raw and clean data, as well as understand the cleaning process.

- Scatter plots in Summary Statistics are important to communicating context to viewers, which is one of my interests and strengths.

- Introduction and Interpretation and Conclusions are examles of mastery of data analysis. These sections exemplify that I can communicate the meaning of complicated technical analyses performed by teammates. 

## Repository organization:

- The main __[jupyter notebook file](/snap_analysis.ipynb)__ contains our final results. 

- The cleaned and merged data is written to a CSV file in the [cleaned_data](/cleaned_data) directory, along with a spreadsheet of variable descriptions.

- A [data cleaning appendix](/data_cleaning_appendix.ipynb) contains all the code to clean and merge the original data into our final dataset, as well as brief descriptions of the original datasets and links to original sources.

- Some utility data and helper functions are stored in [utils.py](/utils.py).

- The images directory contains a few auxiliary charts and figures used in the main document.

- Original datasets and and cleaning were too large to include, but can be sent if necessary.
